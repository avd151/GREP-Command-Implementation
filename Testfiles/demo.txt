Getting up at dawn is for the birds.
This made him feel like an old-style rootbeer float smells.
He didn’t want to go to the dentist, yet he went anyway.
He looked behind the door and didn't like what he saw.
I'm confused: when people ask me what's up, and I point, they groan.
The door slammed on the watermelon.
The wake behind the boat told of the past while the open sea for told life in the unknown future.
It was a slippery slope and he was willing to slide all the way to the deepest depths.
As she walked along the street and looked in the gutter, she realized facemasks had become the new cigarette butts.
The lyrics of the song sounded like fingernails on a chalkboard.
